            question: "What is the event loop?",
            answer: "The event loop is a fundamental concept in JavaScript that handles asynchronous operations. It continuously checks the call stack and the task queue. When the call stack is empty, it takes tasks from the queue and pushes them onto the call stack for execution.",

            question: "Explain the concept of prototypal inheritance.",
            answer: "In JavaScript, objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects. Each object has a prototype, and if a property or method is not found on the object itself, JavaScript looks for it in the prototype chain. This allows for efficient sharing of behavior between objects.",
